    <H1><em>This Page gonna be about<strong> Wolf</strong></em></h1>
    <p>The wolf (Canis lupus pl: wolves), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf,
        is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America. More than thirty subspecies 
        of Canis lupus have been recognized, including the dog and dingo, though gray wolves,
        as popularly understood, only comprise naturally-occurring wild subspecies.
        The wolf is the largest extant member of the family Canidae, and is further distinguished
        from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. 
        The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, 
        to produce fertile hybrids with them. The wolf's fur is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black, 
        although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white.</p>
